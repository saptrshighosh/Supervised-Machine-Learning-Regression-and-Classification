# Supervised-Machine-Learning-Regression-and-Classification

Supervised machine learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled training data, and makes predictions based on this learned knowledge. It involves two main types of tasks: regression and classification.

### Regression

**Definition:**
Regression is a type of supervised learning used when the output variable is a continuous value. It aims to predict a real number for given input data.

**Common Algorithms:**
1. **Linear Regression:** Models the relationship between input features and output using a linear equation.
2. **Polynomial Regression:** Extends linear regression by considering polynomial relationships between input features and output.
3. **Ridge Regression:** A variant of linear regression that includes a regularization term to prevent overfitting.
4. **Lasso Regression:** Another regularization technique that can shrink some coefficients to zero, effectively performing feature selection.
5. **Decision Trees:** Splits the data into subsets based on feature values, useful for capturing non-linear relationships.
6. **Support Vector Regression (SVR):** Uses support vector machine concepts for regression problems.

**Example Use Cases:**
- Predicting house prices based on features like size, location, and number of bedrooms.
- Estimating stock prices or sales revenue over time.

### Classification

**Definition:**
Classification is a type of supervised learning used when the output variable is a category. It aims to assign input data to one of several predefined classes.

**Common Algorithms:**
1. **Logistic Regression:** A linear model for binary classification problems.
2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Classifies data based on the majority class among the k-nearest neighbors.
3. **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** Finds the hyperplane that best separates the classes in the feature space.
4. **Decision Trees:** Splits the data into subsets based on feature values to classify input data.
5. **Random Forest:** An ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and merges their results.
6. **Naive Bayes:** Based on Bayes' theorem, assuming independence among features.
7. **Neural Networks:** Deep learning models that can capture complex patterns in data.

**Example Use Cases:**
- Email spam detection: Classifying emails as spam or not spam.
- Image recognition: Identifying objects within an image, such as distinguishing between cats and dogs.
- Medical diagnosis: Classifying patient data to predict the presence of a disease.

### Key Differences

- **Output Type:**
  - Regression: Continuous values.
  - Classification: Discrete classes.

- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - Regression: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R-squared.
  - Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC.

- **Example Outputs:**
  - Regression: Predicting the price of a house.
  - Classification: Classifying an email as spam or not spam.

### Steps Involved in Both Types

1. **Data Collection:** Gather labeled data relevant to the problem.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean the data, handle missing values, and perform feature scaling or encoding.
3. **Feature Selection:** Identify the most relevant features for the model.
4. **Model Training:** Use the training data to fit the model.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Assess the modelâ€™s performance on the test data using appropriate metrics.
6. **Model Tuning:** Adjust hyperparameters to improve model performance.
7. **Prediction:** Use the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data.

Both regression and classification are foundational to many practical applications of machine learning, and understanding the differences and appropriate use cases for each is crucial for building effective predictive models.
